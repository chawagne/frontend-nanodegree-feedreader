# Introduction

This project is a RSS feed reader that provides links to articles from a few different sources.  This code was not written by me, however the bottom of the page displays a `Jasmine` div.  This section is generated from the Jasmine test framework.  The tests being run on the page were written by me to ensure the page's functionality.  If all specs are green, all tests have passed.

# How to run
Open `index.html` in a browser.

# Dependences

None.  Just a browser.

# Resources
* Jasmine
* jQuery
* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS

# Contributing
